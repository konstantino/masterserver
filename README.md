# masterserver

As mentioned in this description of the project this is a mere copy of Unity's MasterServer (http://unity3d.com/master-server) that already includes the updated DS_BinarySearchTree.h to ease compilation in OSX environments (tested in with Yosemite 10.10.5). To use this, just clone and type make.
